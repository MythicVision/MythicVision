# MythicVision
## Purpose
 Mythic Vision is designed to be a marine navigation and vision management system for the United Kingdoms inland waterways system. 
 
 The main goal is to provide a visual support system to aid visually impaired users to navigating via locks and other waterway features. This is provided by the use of pan and tilt camaras mounted the front and sides of a vessel. Allowing closer views for those unable to see detail accross the front and side of a long vessel.
